## Notes

### 1. Analyzing the data

By analyzing [`pokemons.json`](./pokemons.json), I found out:

- Pok√©mon "types" are common within:
  - _"types"_
  - _"resistant"_
  - _"weaknesses"_
  - and even attacks' _"type"_ (as attack against specific Pok√©mon type)

- Other keywords describing similar data:
  - _"weight"_  / _"height"_
  - _"fast"_ / _"special"_ (move)
  - and finally, _"classification"_

I have used **Hygen** to generate code for these _enums_. In the case of _"classification"_, I have **removed** the "Pok√©mon" word from every classification as it seems redundant and can be harder to type into database because of the "√©".

### 2. Database

Assuming Pok√©mon data remains static, the database should be optimized for fast reads, minimizing unnecessary joins and implementing other performance enhancements.

As a way to achieve this, I have stored Pok√©mon types as **_"type1"_** and **_"type2"_**, since Pok√©mon can be of at most two types.
Both types are _enums_, with _type1_ required and _type2_ optional. They cannot be the same type.

I have enabled _Index_-es on both columns **_"type1"_** and **_"type2"_** for faster search.

Speaking of _Index_-es, I have enabled **GIN** on column **_"name"_** (requires `pg_trgm`).

Along the way I defined various _constraints_ for integrity checks, which proved helpful when I got to Migrations.

#### Entities, Migrations and Seeding

In all three cases, I used **MikroORM**. I first defined Entities (or Modules), then used them to create the initial migration, and finally seeded the database.

#### Relationships

The most interesting relationship to me was the Pok√©mon evolutions, which I modeled using a _one-to-one_, or _self-referencing_, relationship.

### 3. API

I used **Fastify** to develop the API. To document the endpoints and define constraints, I leveraged _JSON Schema_. Fastify _plugins_ were then used to generate **Swagger** documentation from this information.

All endpoints are publicly accessible. However, getting a list of favorite Pok√©mon requires authentication, as does adding or removing Pok√©mon from favorites.

I assume the API is running behind a _reverse proxy_ which does the authentication, and sets **"x-webauth-user"** header if user is authenticated.

### 4. Linting

To assure code quality, I used **Biome**.

### 5. Tests

For Unit tests I used **Tap**. There are plenty of API tests done in **Hurl**.
